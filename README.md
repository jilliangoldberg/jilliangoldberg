### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jillian and I'm a student at UC Berkeley, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science + Business Administration. I'm a part of the Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.) program, which is a cohort of 50 students each year in a collaborative, double-degree program.

I'm passionate about data science and machine learning, and using technology to solve consumer-centric problems. I'm currently seeking opportunities in Data Science/ML for Spring 2022 and Summer 2022. Feel free to reach out anytime! :)
