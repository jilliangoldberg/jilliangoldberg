### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is **Jillian** and I'm a student at **UC Berkeley**, studying [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu/). I'm a part of the [Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.)](https://met.berkeley.edu/) program, which is a cohort of 50 students each year in a collaborative, double-degree program.

Iâ€™m passionate about **data science and machine learning**, and using technology to solve consumer-centric problems. I'm currently seeking opportunities in Data Science/ML for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. Check out my [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jilliangoldberg/) and feel free to reach out anytime! :)
